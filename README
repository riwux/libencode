 libencode
+----------+

libencode provides interfaces to operate on plain unicode codepoints and UTF-8
encoded strings.
It doesn't provide any I/O functions, advanced buffering or other complicated
features. libencode is meant to be used as a base for more sophisticated
interfaces and programs. It conveniently handles the low-level encoding/decoding
of data while the user builds upon that and focuses on the specific needs of the
application in question.
